## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a superior door lock security system mechanicsm with the help of IOT and cloud integrating with mobile application giving us the power to the user for various home security  features at the palm of their hand.
Smart digital lock security system is designed using RASPBERRY PI 3B+ where once the
correct code or password is entered, the door is opened and the concerned person is allowed
access to the secured area. Smart digital lock security system using RASPBERRY PI 3B+ is a
simple project where a secure password will act as a door unlocking system.

### Working

* User has to interact with our system using mobile app.
* Images will be taken on any object detection.
* Images can be accessed from cloud using mobile application.
* AC appliances can be switched from the mobile App.
* For better clarity of images a small LED will glow up during darker atmosphere.




## Key Features

* Accessing from Anywhere
* Accessing the Door Lock Securtiy system through Mobile App
* Proivides Control of AC Home Appliances using mobile app
* 2- Step Verification Login Screen providing MFA Security
* Capturing photo of intruders and keeping it on cloud Data Storage
* Automatic Light control Based on Day/Night light intensity
* Downloading Photos Into our mobile to from Cloud data storage
* Resetting CLoud storage Option in our mobile app

## Software Used

* Python <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg/1200px-Python-logo-notext.svg.png" width="10">
* Java
